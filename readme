Path Planning is an important technique in both static and dynamic worlds. It can be considered a trivial task in static environments; however, it is very difficult to plan in a dynamically changing world with constrained time limits and limited trajectory costs. Path Planning through A* is better than Dijkstraâ€™s or Best-First Search Algorithms for known environments. In this paper, we propose several variants of A* algorithms for known, unknown, static and dynamic environments. We then provide a detailed analysis and comparison of these search algorithms. The experimental results show that Adaptive A* Algorithms such as Real-Time Adaptive A* is able to compute path in real time while Incremental Heuristic Search Methods such as D* Lite computes the path by exploring less number of nodes compared to other search methods.
